# 🔄 Manual Redeploy Required

## ⚠️ Issue Detected:

Render is deploying OLD commit: `46407a1d9` (without fixes)
Our NEW commit with fixes: `5b54f33` (just pushed)

**Render needs to detect the new commit and redeploy!**

---

## ✅ Solution: Manual Redeploy on Render

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
https://dashboard.render.com

### Step 2: Select Your Service
Click on **"phishguard-ngwd"** service

### Step 3: Trigger Manual Deploy
1. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
2. Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
3. Click **"Deploy"**

### Step 4: Watch Logs
- Click **"Logs"** tab
- You should now see:
  ```
  ==> Checking out commit 5b54f33...
  ==> Using Node.js version 20.18.0
  ==> Running build command 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build'
  ```
- Build should succeed! ✅

## 🎯 Alternative: Wait for Auto-Deploy

If `autoDeploy: true` is working, Render should automatically detect the new commit within 1-2 minutes.

**Check if it auto-deploys by refreshing the Render logs.**

---

## 📊 What to Look For in New Build:

### Success Indicators:
```
✅ Using Node.js version 20.18.0 (not 18.17.0)
✅ npm install --legacy-peer-deps (new flag)
✅ sharp installation (may skip - that's OK!)
✅ npm run build succeeds
✅ npm start succeeds
✅ Ready on http://0.0.0.0:10000
```

### Build Time:
- First build: 3-5 minutes
- Subsequent builds: 2-3 minutes

---

## 🆘 If Still Using Old Commit:

### Check Render Settings:

1. **Verify Branch**:
   - Settings → Branch: Should be `main`

2. **Verify Auto-Deploy**:
   - Settings → Auto-Deploy: Should be `ON`

3. **Force Redeploy**:
   - Manual Deploy → Clear build cache → Deploy latest commit

---

**Go to Render Dashboard now and click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"!** 🚀
